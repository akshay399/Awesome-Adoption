        <p>
          Adopting pets is a much more humane way to find your family&apos;s
          newest best friend. Every year around 6.5 million companion pets enter
          shelte rs in just the USA, and that&apos;s only dogs and cats. Out of
          those
          <span> 6.5 million</span>, only <span>3.2 million</span> are adopted
          and
          <span> 1.5 million</span> are euthanized (Statistics provided by

          Adopting a pet is cheaper than buying a pet, and you also potentially
          save a life by doing so. Many shelter pets are already house-trained
          and are used to living with humans.{" "}

          Covid-19 is a newly found infectious disease that belongs to the
          Coronavirus family. The virus causes a respiratory infection which to
          some people is a minor problem, but to others could be very deadly
          depending on many different factors. The World Health Organization has
          announced that Covid-19 is considered a pandemic. Many countries have
          issued stay-at-home orders or recommendations to quarantine and self
          isolate.
